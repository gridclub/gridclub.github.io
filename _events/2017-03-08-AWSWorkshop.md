### What: 
{{page.title}}


### Where:
{{page.location}}


### When:
{{page.date | date_to_long_string}} {{page.time}}


### Why

AWS is a way to get instant access to whatever computing power you need, without paying for the hardware. 

This can be useful for researchers that need high performance computing capability. 
Used correctly, it can be incredibly cost effective, and it's easier to use and much more versatile than free options like the MGHPCC. 
If you've ever had a computation that was slowing down your workflow, AWS might be the way to go!


### Details:

No background will be assumed for this workshop, just be sure to bring your computer. 
Also, it would be helpful to set up an AWS account ahead of time [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html?utm_source=GRiD&utm_campaign=e80acf10c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_03_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_faabe00dc6-e80acf10c9-368572485). 
Step 1 should be enough. 
You may be asked for credit card information, but we will be using the "free tier" services only during the workshop, and there are no signup/membership fees.

Here's an outline of what we'll cover:

* Basics of what AWS offers
* Pricing system
* Creating and connecting to instances
* Installing software
* Running and monitoring code. 

Light refreshments will be provided. We hope to see you there!
