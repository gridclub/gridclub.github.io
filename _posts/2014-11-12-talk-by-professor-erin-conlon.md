Professor Erin Conlon of the Mathematics & Statistics Department at UMass Amherst is going to give a talk for GRiD on Bayesian Methods in Data Science. 

## Abstract

In this talk, I will give a general introduction to Bayesian methods and their implementation through Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. A real-world large data set will illustrate the use of Bayesian models, and highlight their advantages. I will also introduce methods for parallel computing with Bayesian models in data science and big data; these methods use subset data when the full data set cannot be analyzed in its entirety. 

You can find Professor Conlon's website [here](http://people.math.umass.edu/~conlon/index.html). After her talk, we will put our new knowledge to the test on the dataset from the previous week.
