Thursday, October 9, we had a meeting about visualizations with different tools. Here you can find links to the tools we talked about. 

# ggplot

[Steele's presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4JwQ7883JIGbUszYy03c1FmcjQ/view?usp=sharing).


# Plotly

* Getting started with [ggplot2 and Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/).

* [Plotly and Python](https://plot.ly/matplotlib/getting-started/).

A great thing about plotly is that you can share the graphs on your webpage (by using the html **iframe** command).
