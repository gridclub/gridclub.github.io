Although information on this website is kept up-to-date, communication within the group is handled through three different mailing lists. Append @cns.umass.edu to the name of each list.  

# grid
This is a member-only mailing list. Members use this to announce new events, ask questions and generally talk to each other. It is expected to be mail-heavy, so it's not recommended for someone that isn't a regular member. 

To subscribe to this list, visit [this website.](https://list.umass.edu/mailman/listinfo/grid) Note that membership requests are moderated and members are expected to be graduate students at UMass Amherst.

This is **not** an open mailing list; Only members can add posts or reply to posts. 

# grid-officers
This is the mailing list for the officers of the group. Officers use this to talk about events and plan meetings. 

This is an open mailing list. Non-members can send an e-mail to the officers through this list. In fact, it is recommended that you follow this approach instead of sending to an officer separately.

# grid-support
This is the mailing list for supporters of the grid group, that is interested parties that are not in the graduate school. Regular meetings are usually not announched here, only talks/workshops. This is the mailing list to subscribe to if you want to stay up-to-date on events but don't want to see the full discussion. 

You can subscribe to this list [here](https://list.umass.edu/mailman/listinfo/grid-support).

**Note** : It is important that this list remains spam-free and only has relevant information. For this reason, posts to this list are moderated. You can send an e-mail to this list without being a member to it. When you do, you will get back a "bounce" e-mail like the following.
